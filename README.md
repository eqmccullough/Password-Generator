# Password Generator - Module 3 Challenge

In this challenge I was tasked with creating a password generator in which the user could select the password length and the types of characters that would appear in the password. I utilized if statements, a for loop, prompts, math commands for randomization, arrays, and more to complete the assignment.

I did this assignment 100% on my own but utilized online resources such as

- herewecode.io
- w3schools.com
- mdn web docs
